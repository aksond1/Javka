### Sections Ð¡ompleted: 4/45

So, here's the course - Java Masterclass by Tim Buchalka. I bought it for my birthday, and it's finally time to start!  

I also would like to add a section here, where I'll write a short answer to:  

What did I learn or repeat during this session ?  
\- I remembered about the JShell, haven't use it for a very long time, so it's was nice to write some basic commands. It's the beginning of the course, so here's only info for repeating


### 16.
```java
jshell> int num = 10;
num ==> 10

jshell> System.out.print(num);
10
jshell> num = 1000;
num ==> 1000

jshell> System.out.print(num);
1000
jshell>
```

### 21.
```java
jshell> byte numByte = 20;
numByte ==> 20

jshell> short numShort = 20000;
numShort ==> 20000

jshell> int numInt = 200000;
numInt ==> 200000

jshell> long numLong = 50000L + (10 * (numByte + numShort + numInt));
numLong ==> 2250200
```

### 27.
```java
jshell> {
   ...>     int result = 10;
   ...>     result -= 6;
   ...>     System.out.print(result);
   ...> }
4
```

### 40.
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double doubleValue1 = 20.00;
        double doubleValue2 = 80.00;

        double totalValue = doubleValue1 + doubleValue2 * 100;

        double remainder = totalValue % 40.00;

        boolean booleanValue = remainder == 0.0 ? true : false;

        System.out.println(booleanValue);

        if (!booleanValue) {
            System.out.println("Got some remainder");
        }
    }
}
```

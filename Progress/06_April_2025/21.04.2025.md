What did I learn or repeat during this session ?  
\- For me, this is still the info for repeating, but the course seems very good.

### 45.
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean gameOver = true;

        int score = 800;
        int levelCompleted = 5;
        int bonus = 100;

        int finalScore = score;

        if (gameOver) {
            finalScore += (levelCompleted * bonus);
            System.out.println("Your final score was " + finalScore);
        }

        score = 10000;
        levelCompleted = 8;
        bonus = 200;

        finalScore = score;

        if (gameOver) {
            finalScore += (levelCompleted * bonus);
            System.out.println("Your final score was " + finalScore);
        }
    }
}
```

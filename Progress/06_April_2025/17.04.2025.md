So.. The JavaRush Course ends tomorrow. I'm really greatful for this course about java, but he's also has negative sides. I end up at 36 lvl, so I decided to skip a few levels till 40+ lvl (it's the level where the course ends).  
Here's my JavaRush profile - https://javarush.com/ua/users/3101979.  
I also bought the course on Udemy and I'm about to start it from next Monday!  
I would like to become a Java geek someday)

# Berserk

Berserk is a Java 2D game, inspirated by [Blue Boy Adventure](https://ryisnow.itch.io/blue-boy-adventure). @RyiSnow is truly a legend, he's the man who makes you love java /

I would like to recreate this game by guides from [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI&list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq), just for educational purposes, nothing more. I really like Berserk, Java, and also I would like to try something in GameDev, so it's about time.
